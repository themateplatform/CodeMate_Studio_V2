6. UI/UX Style Notes

Keep the content overlays white so they stand out clearly over the neon gradient background.

Gradients = branding, not clutter. Use them for hero headline, CTAs, card accents.

Animations (optional):

Input box glow pulses slightly when focused.

CTA buttons have a hover shimmer.

Background gradient can have a subtle slow drift for energy.

This makes the homepage instantly recognizable as BuildMate Studio — bold, creative, futuristic, but structured and professional.
