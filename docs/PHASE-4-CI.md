## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### 1. Phase-Gated CI/CD
**Decision**: Implement branch-based phase isolation with automated quality gates

**Rationale**:
- Ensures each phase can be developed, tested, and merged independently
- Prevents contamination of main branch during development
- Enables selective rollbacks without affecting other phases
- Maintains production stability while allowing rapid iteration

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# Branch patterns for phase isolation
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, 'agent/**']
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
```

### 2. Parallel Quality Gates
**Decision**: Run lint, type-check, tests, and security scans in parallel

**Rationale**:
- Faster feedback loops for developers
- Efficient resource utilization
- Early failure detection across multiple quality dimensions
- Scalable as project grows

**Implementation**:
```yaml
jobs:
  lint-and-type-check: # Parallel job 1
  test:                # Parallel job 2  
  security-scan:       # Parallel job 3
  build:               # Depends on all above
    needs: [lint-and-type-check, test, security-scan]
```

### 3. Security-First Pipeline
**Decision**: Mandatory security validation at every stage

**Rationale**:
- Security is non-negotiable for production deployment
- Early detection prevents security debt accumulation
- Automated scanning reduces human error
- Compliance with enterprise security requirements

**Implementation**:
- npm audit with high-severity threshold
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret scanning (future enhancement)
- Security-focused code review requirements

### 4. Conventional Commits with Phase Awareness
**Decision**: Extend conventional commits with phase-specific scopes

**Rationale**:
- Automated changelog generation
- Clear commit categorization
- Phase-aware release notes
- Improved developer experience

**Implementation**:
```javascript
'scope-enum': [
  'core', 'ui', 'api', 'auth', 'db', 'ci',
  'phase-1', 'phase-2', 'phase-3', // ... phase-12
]
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### 1. Secret Management
- All secrets managed through GitHub Secrets
- No secrets in repository or build artifacts
- Secure environment variable injection
- Service account permissions principle of least privilege

### 2. Dependency Security
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- High-severity threshold enforcement
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot (future)
- Lock file validation

### 3. Build Security
- Immutable build environments
- Artifact integrity verification
- Secure deployment keys
- Audit trail for all deployments

### 4. Branch Protection
- Required status checks
- Require PR reviews
- Restrict force pushes
- Dismiss stale reviews

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### 1. Multi-Layer Testing
```yaml
# Testing pyramid implementation
Unit Tests:    Fast, isolated, comprehensive coverage
Integration:   API endpoints, database interactions  
E2E Tests:     Critical user journeys, browser automation
Security:      Vulnerability scanning, audit checks
```

### 2. Test Environment Management
