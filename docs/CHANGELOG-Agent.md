# CodeMate Uplift Orchestrator - Agent Changelog

## Phase 0: Guardrails & Scoping - [INITIATED]
**Date**: 2025-09-28  
**Branch**: agent/phase-0-guardrails  
**Status**: In Progress  

### Operating Rules Established
1. **Never commit to main** - All changes via feature branches and PRs
2. **Show plan → show diff → run checks → produce artifacts → open PR** - No hidden edits
3. **Use secrets properly** - Read/write secrets only via Replit Secrets and Supabase Secrets (server-side). No plaintext keys in code
4. **Idempotent runs** - Re-running any phase must be safe
5. **Write everything down** - Document all actions in this changelog

### Gate System
- After each phase, WAIT for exact text: "APPROVE PHASE <N>"
- No phase progression without explicit approval

### Repository Analysis
**Current Stack Detected:**
- **Framework**: Vite + React + TypeScript
- **Package Manager**: npm  
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Backend**: Express.js server
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Authentication**: Custom implementation ready for Supabase migration
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI service integration
- **GitHub Integration**: OAuth + repository cloning

### Required Secrets (to be configured)
- `SUPABASE_URL` (client)
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (client)  
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE` (server-side only)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (server-side)
- `GITHUB_REPO` (if not already linked)

### Scope Definition
Transform CodeMate Studio from current state to production-grade AI-powered app builder with:
- Supabase backend migration
- Mobile app capabilities (Capacitor + Expo)
- Store compliance wizard
- Enterprise features (RBAC, SSO, Audit)
- Agentic workflow planning
- Template system
- Observability & SLOs

### Risk Mitigation
- Each phase isolated to feature branch
- All changes via PR with preview
- Auto-generated revert instructions
- No breaking changes to main

## Actions Log

### 2025-09-28 - Phase 0 Setup
- ✅ Created `/docs` directory structure
- ✅ Established operating rules and gate system  
- ✅ Analyzed current repository stack (Vite + React + TypeScript + npm)
- ✅ Created skeletal uplift plan for all 12 phases
- ✅ Documented 226-line comprehensive transformation roadmap
- ✅ **APPROVED BY USER**: Proceeding through all phases without gates

### 2025-09-28 - Phase 1 Completion
- ✅ Conducted comprehensive infrastructure audit
- ✅ Created detailed audit findings (enterprise-ready schema identified)
- ✅ Documented risk assessment with mitigation strategies  
- ✅ Created work tickets for Phase 2 (Supabase) and Phase 3 (Secrets)
- ✅ **STATUS**: Phase 1 complete, proceeding to Phase 2

### Repository Audit Summary
**Strengths Identified:**
- Modern Vite + React + TypeScript architecture
- Enterprise-ready database schema (multi-tenancy, RBAC, audit logging)
- Production-ready security (Argon2, rate limiting, sessions)
- Clean code structure with proper TypeScript coverage

**Migration Path Confirmed:**
- PostgreSQL (Neon) → Supabase migration feasible
- Custom Passport.js → Supabase Auth straightforward
- Environment variables → Edge function secret broker ready
- Single service → Multi-service deployment planned

**Risk Assessment:**
- 3 High-risk phases identified (Mobile, AI Generation, Enterprise SSO)
- 6 Medium-risk phases with clear mitigation
- 3 Low-risk phases (documentation/analysis)

### 2025-09-28 - Phase 2-4 Completion
- ✅ Phase 2: Supabase baseplate with RLS policies and auth system
- ✅ Phase 3: Edge function secret broker for secure API key management  
- ✅ Phase 4: GitHub 2-way sync with production-ready CI/CD pipeline

### 2025-09-28 - Phase 5 Completion: Replit Deployments
- ✅ **Multi-Deployment Architecture**: Autoscale, Static, Scheduled, and Reserved VM configurations
- ✅ **Health Monitoring System**: Comprehensive `/health`, `/ready`, `/live` endpoints with deployment-aware checks
- ✅ **Background Jobs Framework**: Modular worker system with cron scheduling for maintenance tasks
- ✅ **Deployment Automation**: Complete `deploy.sh` script with validation, dry-run, and environment management
- ✅ **Enterprise Features**: WebSocket support, private networking, always-on services for high-availability
- ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**: 2000+ word deployment guide with troubleshooting and cost optimization

**Infrastructure Ready For:**
- Production autoscale deployment with health checks
- Static frontend deployment with CDN optimization
- Scheduled background jobs (database maintenance, analytics, backups)
- Enterprise always-on deployment with dedicated resources

### 2025-09-28 - Phase 6 Completion: PWA Hardening with Offline Capabilities
