## Funnel Stages

### Stage 1: Briefing Interview (FREE)

**Goal**: Understand the user's vision, goals, target audience, and constraints.

**Questions Asked**:
- Project type: "Starting from scratch or finishing an existing project?"
  - Greenfield (new project)
  - Completion (existing GitHub repo)
- Project goals: "What's the primary goal? (generate leads, sell products, build community, etc.)"
- Target audience: "Who are your customers?"
- Revenue model: "How do you make money? (subscriptions, e-commerce, services, etc.)"
- Core features: "What's essential for launch? (auth, payments, CMS, etc.)"
- Brand preference:
  - Use DesignMate tokens (curated by Mate)
  - Import custom brand kit
  - Create new branding
- Existing GitHub repo URL (if completion project)

**Output**: User profile + intake answers stored in database

**Time**: ~2-3 minutes

**Conversion to Stage 2**: 100% (automatic)

---

### Stage 2: Research & Scope Document Generation (FREE)

**Goal**: Create a detailed scope document so user understands what will be built before paying.

#### For Greenfield Projects:
- Market/industry research
- Competitor analysis
- User journey mapping
- Technology stack recommendation (React + TS + Tailwind + Drizzle)
- Data model design
- Page/feature list
- Integration requirements
- Success metrics

#### For Completion Projects:
- Repo cloning & analysis
- Tech stack detection
- TODO scanning (extract `// TODO:` comments)
- Incomplete feature detection
- Missing infrastructure assessment (CI/CD, testing, SEO, etc.)
- Completion roadmap
- Recommendations for improvements

**Output**: Detailed, human-readable scope document in markdown

**Time**: ~5 minutes (automated generation)

**User Action**: Review scope and either:
- ‚úÖ Approve ‚Üí Move to Stage 3
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è Request revisions ‚Üí Re-generate with feedback

**Conversion to Stage 3**: ~75% (some users refine scope, some abandon)

---

### Stage 3: Concept/Mood Board Selection (FREE)

**Goal**: Let user pick their visual direction before committing to payment.

**What We Generate**: 3 distinct mood boards with:
- Inspiration images (6-8 curated or AI-generated images)
- Color palette (primary, secondary, accent, background, text)
- Typography (heading & body fonts with samples)
- Style notes (spacing, corners, contrast, imagery style)
- Small component previews (button, card, input examples)

**Important**: These are NOT full-page mockups‚Äîjust visual atmosphere and direction.

**User Action**: Select one of 3 mood boards that resonates with their vision

**Constraints**:
- If user selected a brand kit in Stage 1, all 3 mood boards use that kit's colors/fonts
- Variations are in layout approach and imagery style only
- Ensures multi-project customers maintain brand consistency

**Output**: Selected concept ID + design tokens (CSS variables, Tailwind config)

**Time**: ~3 minutes (user decision)

**Conversion to Stage 4**: ~85% (most users reach this point, many select a direction)

---

### Stage 4: Pricing & Payment (CONVERSION GATE) üéØ

**Goal**: Show transparent pricing, collect payment, and lock in the build commitment.

#### Pricing Calculation

```
Base Price:
  Greenfield: $500

#### Pricing UI

User sees:
1. **Itemized breakdown** (base + pages + integrations)
2. **Complexity explanation** (why multiplier applied)
3. **Total price in dollars**
4. **What's included** (production build, SEO, accessibility, 30-day support)
5. **Money-back guarantee** ("If we don't deliver what's scoped, full refund")

## Brand Kit System (Multi-Project Consistency)

### Problem It Solves
Agencies building multiple sites want consistent branding without re-specifying colors/fonts each time.

### Solution
1. **Create once**: Define colors, fonts, logo, guidelines
2. **Reuse freely**: Select existing kit when starting new project
3. **Guaranteed consistency**: All projects use the same brand elements
4. **Fast turnaround**: Skips brand research for subsequent projects

### Implementation
- Users can create unlimited brand kits
- When starting new project, select existing kit or create new
- Pricing benefits: Second+ projects slightly cheaper (no design research time)
- Mood boards vary layout/imagery, never brand elements (if kit selected)

---

## Free Tier Strategy

### Why Free Tiers Work
- **Low barrier to entry**: No credit card required
- **Builds trust**: User sees quality before paying
- **Captures intent**: Scope + mood boards prove value
- **Reduces decision anxiety**: Price shown after commitment to direction

### Monetization Points
1. **Freemium funnel**: Biggest acquisition channel
2. **Free tier ceiling**: Reach Stage 4 (pricing) but can't build
3. **Upsell logic**: "You're 30 seconds from a production site‚Äîjust $X"
4. **Repeat purchases**: Agencies building multiple projects

### Protecting Free Resources
- Scope generation: Rate-limited to 5/day per user
- Mood boards: Re-generated for free once, then $20 to refresh
- Preview deployments: 24-hour expiry unless paid

---

## Payment & Fulfillment

### Payment Flow
1. User sees itemized pricing
2. Clicks "Start Build"
3. Stripe checkout opens
4. User enters card details (Stripe handles PCI)
5. Payment processed
6. `paidAt` timestamp recorded
7. Build immediately starts
8. Build status page shows real-time progress

### Receipts & Invoices
- Email receipt sent after payment
- Invoice available in user dashboard
- Breakdown shows exactly what was built

### Refund Policy
- **Within 30 days**: Full refund if not satisfied + proof of effort
- **After 30 days**: Partial refund up to support cost
- **Never**: If deployed to production and generating revenue
